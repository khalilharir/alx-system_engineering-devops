Issue Summary:

Duration: February 20, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 20, 2024, 1:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime, causing service disruptions for approximately 30% of users. Users reported slow loading times and sporadic errors during the outage.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers, leading to overloading and subsequent service degradation.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating an increase in server response times.
10:05 AM: Engineering team notified of the issue via automated alerting system.
10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on backend server health and network connectivity.
10:30 AM: Misleading assumption made that the issue was due to a sudden surge in user traffic.
10:45 AM: Escalation to network operations team for further diagnosis.
11:00 AM: Detailed examination revealed load balancer misconfiguration as the likely cause.
11:30 AM: Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across backend servers.
12:00 PM: Service restoration observed as traffic normalized and error rates decreased.
1:00 PM: Incident resolved with full service functionality restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused uneven distribution of traffic, resulting in overloaded servers and service degradation.
Resolution: Load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute incoming traffic across all backend servers, restoring balance and alleviating the overload.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated load balancer configuration checks to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of traffic imbalances and server overloads.
Tasks:
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Develop and implement automated testing procedures for load balancer configurations to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Enhance team training and documentation on load balancer management best practices to mitigate future incidents.
